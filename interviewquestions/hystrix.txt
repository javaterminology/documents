basically hystrix is an fault tolerance library.
hystrix is useful in distributed applications like to check exteranl service running or not.
in distributed applications if suppose u r booking ticket from some website and while payment it will connect some payment ms and payment
details are strored in database and after that send notification via email(SMTP) IS another service.if any failure in any of the service then 
failure will delegate notification->payment->applocation.so to stop delegating failure to all services hystrix will be used to break 
the circuit. 

instead of showing raw error msg using hystrix can show fall back error reponse.

let say if one service is down then we will get internal server error 500.this is raw error message.
if using hystrix we can throw fallback response so application should not break.
ex: server gateway failed
